# Highridge Construction Payment System

This project helps Highridge Construction Company calculate and print payment slips for 400 workers every week.

## What it does
- Creates 400 fake workers with random salaries and gender
- Checks the salary and gender to assign them a level:
  - If salary is between $10,000 and $20,000, then the Level is A1
  - If salary is between $7,500 and $30,000 AND the worker is female, then the Level is A5-F
- Shows a payment slip for each worker
- Handles errors if anything goes wrong
